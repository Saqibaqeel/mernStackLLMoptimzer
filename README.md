# 🧠 LLM Optimizer

**LLM Optimizer** is an intelligent application that takes a user's input prompt, queries multiple large language models (LLMs), and selects the best response using another LLM as a judge. The generation models include **DeepSeek**, **LLaMA**, and **Gemma**, while **Gemini** is used for evaluating and ranking the responses.

> 🔮 *Future versions will replace Gemini with a more effective custom-trained ML model for more accurate judgment and response evaluation.*

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Accepts user-generated input prompts
- 🔹 Sends prompts to multiple LLMs in parallel
- 🔹 Uses an LLM (currently Gemini) to judge and select the best response
- 🔹 Secure authentication and authorization using JWT
- 🔹 Efficient state management using Zustand
- 🔹 Fully built with the **MERN Stack**

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Prompt Submission**  
   - User enters a prompt in the frontend UI.

2. **Multi-LLM Generation**  
   - Backend forwards the prompt to multiple LLMs (DeepSeek, LLaMA, Gemma).
   - Each LLM returns its own response.

3. **Judging the Best Response**  
   - All responses are passed to the judge model (Gemini).
   - Gemini ranks them based on relevance, coherence, and completeness.

4. **Final Output**  
   - The best-ranked response is sent back to the user.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- User registration and login are handled using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- Protected routes ensure only authorized users can access key features.
- Session management is stateless and secure.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- 🧠 **Custom Judge Model**: Replace Gemini with a more effective ML model trained specifically for ranking LLM outputs.
- 🗳️ User feedback integration to further improve response selection.
- ⚡ Enhanced performance with caching and parallel LLM calls.
- 🌍 Support for additional LLMs and languages.
